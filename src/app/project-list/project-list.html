      <h2>GIMS (Game Inventory Management System)</h2>
      <h3>A database management software using JavaFX and MySQL
        for Java Programming 3</h3>

      <p>
        For our final Java project, we made a JavaFX database software
        for managing your video game collection. It lets users create,
        view, edit, and update records in their video game library across
        different platforms.

      <h2>Space Game</h2>
      <h3>A fixed-shooter game for Java Programming 2</h3>

      <p>
        For my second semester Java group project, I worked with 2 other
        students to create a fun mini-game using JavaFX.
      </p>

      <p>
        This game is based on Space Invaders and Galaga, where you pilot
        a ship, and shoot enemies while dodging their bullets. I was
        tasked with coding the player movement, scrolling animation,
        lives, user interface, music and sound player,
        and power ups.
      </p>

      <p>
        Power ups were a new feature I added to make gameplay more
        engaging. When an enemy explodes, it may drop a powerup for
        the player to pick up - shield, giant laser, or 1 up.
        The shield temporarily protects the player from enemy attacks.
        The 1 up gives the player an extra life. Finally, the giant laser
        shoots a powerful laser beam that destroys several enemies at once.

      <h2>Breakout</h2>
      <h3>A mini brick-breaker game and personal high school project
        made with Greenfoot (Java)</h3>

      <p>
        I made a simple brick-breaker game based on Atari Breakout
        as a side project in Grade 12. In the game, you control a
        paddle to deflect the incoming ball onto the blocks above
        and break them. You also need to prevent your ball from
        falling out of the area. The level completes when
        you break all blocks without losing your balls.
