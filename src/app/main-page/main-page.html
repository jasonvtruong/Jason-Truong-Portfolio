    <section>
      <p><strong>Hey there</strong>, I'm an 18 year old
      college student whose interest in technology and
      early discovery of coding led to an ongoing 2-year
      study in Computer Programming.</p>

      <p>I am currently attending St. Clair College, and
      by the end of my program, I plan to get into the
      video game industry as a programmer.</p>
